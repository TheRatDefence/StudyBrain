## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Python:** Follow PEP 8
- **Docstrings:** Use Google-style docstrings
- **Comments:** Explain WHY, not WHAT
- **Naming:** Be descriptive and consistent

### Testing

- Write tests for new MCP tools
- Test agent interactions
- Validate with real HSC content
- Ensure all previous phases still work

### Documentation

- Update phase README if modifying a phase
- Add to ROADMAP.md if creating new features
- Document new MCP tools in V2_System_Architecture.md
- Keep PHASE_CONNECTIONS.md updated

## Phase-Based Development

StudyBrain follows a **10-phase agile approach**. When contributing:

1. **Identify which phase** your contribution affects
2. **Read the phase documentation** in the phase directory
3. **Check PHASE_CONNECTIONS.md** for dependencies
4. **Test integration** with previous phases
