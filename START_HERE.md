# StudyBrain Development - START HERE 🚀

Welcome to the StudyBrain agile development roadmap!

---

## What You're Looking At

This project has been organized into **10 incremental phases** that build on each other, following an **agile/iterative** approach rather than waterfall.

Each phase delivers something **functional and testable**.

## The 10 Phases (Quick Reference)

| Phase | Name | What It Adds | Time |
|-------|------|--------------|------|
| 1 | Core Infrastructure | Flask + coordinator + Physics agent | 1-2d |
| 2 | Quiz System | Question generation, answer submission | 2-3d |
| 3 | Progress Tracking | Con/Func scores, progress view | 2-3d |
| 4 | Multi-Subject | All 6 HSC subjects | 1-2d |
| 5 | FSRS Integration | Spaced repetition scheduling | 2d |
| 6 | Study Sessions | Timer, session persistence | 1-2d |
| 7 | UI Visualization | Charts, LaTeX, polished UI | 2-3d |
| 8 | Sub-Agents | Intelligent question generation | 3-4d |
| 9 | Resource Management | PDF indexing, organization | 2-3d |
| 10 | Cross-Subject | Study recommendations | 2-3d |

**Total:** ~2-3 weeks

## How to Use This Roadmap

### Option 1: Sequential Development (Safest)
1. Read ROADMAP.md
2. Start with Phase 1
3. Complete Phase 1 fully
4. Move to Phase 2
5. Repeat through Phase 10

### Option 2: Fast MVP (Get Something Working Quick)
1. Complete Phases 1-3 (Core + Quizzes + Progress)
2. Skip to Phase 4 (Multi-Subject)
3. **Stop here and use the system!**
4. Add remaining phases as needed

### Option 3: Optimized Path (Some Parallel Work)
1. Complete Phase 1
2. Complete Phase 2
3. Complete Phase 3
4. Add Phase 7 (UI polish) while Phase 3 is fresh
5. Complete Phase 4 (Multi-Subject)
6. Do Phases 5 & 6 in parallel
7. Complete Phases 8-10 sequentially

---

## Working with Different Claude Instances

Each phase is designed to be **self-contained** for a new Claude instance:

1. Open a new Claude Code session
2. Read the phase README (e.g., `Phase-01-Core-Infrastructure/README.md`)
3. Read ROADMAP.md for that phase's details
4. Build the features
5. Test thoroughly
6. Commit to git
7. Move to next phase

---

## Milestones

### ✅ After Phase 3: "Usable MVP"
You can study Physics, take quizzes, see your progress

### ✅ After Phase 4: "Multi-Subject MVP"
All 6 HSC subjects available

### ✅ After Phase 7: "Polished Product"
Professional UI, charts, time tracking

### ✅ After Phase 10: "Complete Vision"
Intelligent recommendations, cross-subject integration

---

## Next Steps

**Right now, do this:**

1. ✅ Read `ROADMAP.md` (understand all phases)
2. ✅ Read `PHASE_CONNECTIONS.md` (understand dependencies)
3. ✅ Review `Design/V2_System_Architecture.md` (technical details)
4. ✅ Check `Design/Implementation_Kickstart.md` (getting started code)
5. ⏭️ Navigate to `Phase-01-Core-Infrastructure/`
6. ⏭️ Start building!

## Key Principles

### Agile Approach
- Build incrementally, not all at once
- Test after each phase
- Use the system as you build it
- Refine based on real usage

### Functional Phases
- Each phase must deliver something working
- Don't move to next phase until current one works
- It's okay to skip phases and come back

### Version Control
- Commit after each phase
- Tag milestones (after Phase 3, 4, 7, 10)
- Can roll back if needed

## Questions?

**"Which phase should I start with?"**
→ Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure)

**"Can I skip phases?"**
→ Yes! After Phase 4 you have a working system. Later phases are enhancements.

**"Can I do phases in parallel?"**
→ Some yes (see PHASE_CONNECTIONS.md), but safest to go sequential.

**"How long will this take?"**
→ Phases 1-4: ~1 week (usable product)
→ Phases 1-7: ~2 weeks (polished product)
→ Phases 1-10: ~3 weeks (complete vision)

**"What if I get stuck?"**
→ Check the Design/ folder for detailed specs
→ Each phase builds on previous - make sure previous phases work first
→ Start a new Claude instance with the phase details
